    "### Overview \n",
    "We will scrape data off of the [SCP Wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/) to obtain data for each SCP. The SCP Wiki has a unique page for each SCP object that contains information about it. Our pipeline will extract specific attributes of an SCP and put them into a dataframe to be used for analysis. Below is a sample of a page for an SCP off of the SCP wiki, [SCP-4141](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4141). \n",
    "![Wiki](Wiki_Screenshot.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some easily visible attributes of the SCP are its number (4141), Class (Safe) and Rating (+102). Based on a more in depth knowledge about SCPs, there are other tropes that we searched the scraped text for, such as if the object had any sub-objects or mentions of D-Class personnel. Then we will use some natural language processing to gather more information about the style of how the SCP was written, such as sentiment analysis. \n",

    "One algorthimn could be to use a Random Forest to look through an unknown SCP and decide what its class should be. Since the entries all have their class directly written in their text, this will have to be removed from the attribute output so it isn't already known about an SCP. This will involve creating a dataframe of many SCPs and their attributes, and converting all attributes to numerical values. This will be easy for things such as True/False, but more difficult for things such as page tags, since there are so many. Then this data will be implemented into a Random Forest classifier. We can use cross-validation to check its accuracy.\n",

    "Another data analysis we are interested in doing but haven't learned in class yet is a recommendation algorithmn. This could be done very similarly to the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, but instead of using the nearest neighbors to estimate a category, we could save what the n nearest neighbors are and use them as recommendations. Or we could use cosine similarity to assign vectors to SCPs and compare their similarity. This would be similar to Netflix's 'More like this' recommmendations. We give the algorithmn an SCP or a few, and it returns several SCPs that have similar attributes. "
